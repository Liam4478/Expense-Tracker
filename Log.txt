Worked on a windows that allows the user to edit the money given in case you acidentally put in the wrong number.

(I plan to finish this tomorrow.)

Sunday 12pm - Monday 12am (12hrs)

- Worked on finishing my project up. I add to change quite a few things to make certain aspects of what I wanted to work properly. 

- There was a lot of mistakes that I had to change and adjust to make this form work and maintain the information you have enetered.

- Added in a feature with JSON that will log what you enter into the drop down boxes.

- Had an issue with January and Rent not being shown when you click onto another month or expense category.(It was annoying.)

- Also had issues with permissions with the files when they were hidden. I stopped trying to hide them.

- I moved buttons around as well as fixed the issue with the dropdown lists. 

- I also added an edit button for the income amount as well as a greyd-out text box that allows you to see both the monthly income and yearly income 
depending on which button you pick.

- There is still more I want to do but I may have to end it here. Unless I have to update anything from feedback.

Adjusted the buttons and layout of the form. I also fixed issues with the form that I ran into. I will attempt to get more feedback soon.
